## Welcome to ForeSITE

Forecasting and Surveillance of Infectious Threats and Epidemics (ForeSITE) is a CDC Center for Integration in the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics (CFA) Insight Net.

The goal of ForeSITE is to:

1. Work collaboratively with local and state health departments and healthcare organizations to implement and iteratively refine tools for outbreak analytics and infectious disease modeling.
2. Evaluate the usability and usefulness of these analytic and modeling tools for public health and healthcare decision-making.
3. Partner with CDC and other Centers in the CFA Centers for Outbreak Analytics and Disease Modeling Network to enhance national capability to respond to infectious disease threats and public health emergencies.
